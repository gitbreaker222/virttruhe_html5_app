LICENCE:
This work is under CC Licence or maybe MIT-Licence or maybe GNU-GPU-something Licence.

I guess I choose MIT for the code and for the future CC-Licence for the stories/game concepts...

Whatever. You can develop your own derivate and also make money with it. If you do so, I'd be happy to hear from it :)
